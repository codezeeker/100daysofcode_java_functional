#### Here is a general plan for 100 days of coding with Java and functional programming:

- **Day 1-10:** Start by getting familiar with the Java programming language. You can do this by working through an online tutorial or by
  following a book. You should focus on the basic concepts of Java,
  such as variables, data types, loops, and control structures.
-   **Day 11-20**: Once you have a basic understanding of Java, start learning about functional programming. You can do this by working
    through online tutorials or by reading a book on the subject. You
    should focus on concepts such as higher-order functions, pure
    functions, and immutability.
-  **Day 21-30:** Practice applying functional programming concepts to Java by working through exercises and projects. You can find a
   variety of exercises online or create your own.
-   **Day 31-40:** Continue to practice and reinforce your knowledge of functional programming in Java. You can also start learning about
    more advanced concepts, such as lazy evaluation, currying, and
    monads.
-   **Day 41-50**: Work on larger projects that incorporate functional programming concepts. This could be a small application or a library
    that uses functional programming techniques.
-   **Day 51-60:** Take a break from coding and focus on learning about other related topics, such as design patterns and software
    architecture. You can also continue to practice your coding skills
    through online challenges or by working on personal projects.
-   **Day 61-70:** Return to coding and start learning about more advanced Java features, such as concurrency and the Java Virtual
    Machine (JVM). You can also continue to work on larger projects and
    practice your skills.
-   **Day 71-80:** Focus on improving your coding efficiency and debugging skills. You can do this by working on more complex projects
    and challenges, and by seeking feedback from other programmers.
-   **Day 81-90:** Continue to work on larger projects and practice your skills. You can also start learning about other programming languages
    and technologies to broaden your skillset.
-   **Day 91-100**: Reflect on your progress and set new goals for your continued learning and development. You can also consider
    participating in online coding communities or joining a local meetup
    group to connect with other programmers and learn from their
    experiences.
